# Workout-Tracker
This is a full stack Workout Tracker application. This website allows a user to track workouts and plot their progress. It also allows users to use ChatGpt Api Calls to predict the weight,reps, and number of sets that a user should perform the next time they do a specific lift. 

## To Set Up
This repo contains the docker files for the backend and frontend part of the server as well as a docker compose. To run the application, download all of the files in the repo and run docker compose up to start both applications. Currently, the frontend server is hosted on localhost:53715.

## Important
In order to access the predict feature, you must set a OPENAI_API_KEY in your env.
